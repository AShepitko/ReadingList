Speaking of ways, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.""A tesseract (in case the reader doesn't know) is a wrinkle in time.

The writer who gave us the matrix and coined the term 'cyberspace' produced a first novel that won the Hugo, Nebula and Philip K. Dick Awards, and lit the fuse on the Cyberpunk movement.
