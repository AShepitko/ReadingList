# Reading List
_An iOS app to record and track reading._

### App functions:

- [x] Add books via barcode scanner
- [ ] Add books via manual entry
- [x] Progress books through read states (_reading_, _to read_ and  _read_)
- [ ] Record start and end dates for reading
- [ ] Display reading time per book
- [x] Implement OS spotlight search for books (_partial_)

### Current stupid things:

- The in-app search works, but you cannot select any of the results without dismissing the search.
